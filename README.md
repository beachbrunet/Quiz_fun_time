## 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

I first had trouble with a creative topic but went with a more,
suited to me personally hobby to make this more enjoyable. I am a big video game nerd and other people could relate to
and actually enjoy my fun little project.

## Requirements

<!-- ----------------------- -->

The overall goal is a timed quiz that stores high scores.
First a homepage will appear with greeting and instructions and more importantly a start button to start it all off.
When hitting the start button: Shows the first question, timmer starts.

Second: After selecting the answer it will move onto the next question.

Last: Quiz ends when all the questions have been answered or the timmer reaches zero.
